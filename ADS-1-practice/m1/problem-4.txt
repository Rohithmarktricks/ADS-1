Weighted Quick Union with path compression:
Idea is to flatten the tree, so the complexity can be reduced while using find().

2,3,5,6 cannot possibly occur during the execution of weighted quick union with path compression.
2 is not possible ------------------ As it is not joining tree with small weight to large weight.
3 is not possible for the same above reason.
5 is not possible as it forms a loop in the tree.
6 is not possible as it forms a loop in the tree.
